- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dmccauley54

- I am hoping to create something that will go by the name of Prospect Analytics. 
- This project will maintain and facilitate a group of sub projects to obtain mission goals and completion.

* Prospect Analytics hopes to create a community that will be known as The Prospect Intelligence Alliance (prospect-intel for short).

- prospect-intel, as a whole, will be the name of our Artificially Intelligent Consciousness.

- In order to obtain mission goals the following building block organizations must be formed under Prospect Analytics and by prospect-intel.

* Prospect Foundation - the builders of our community and mission stations. We need a launch station

* Prospect Academy - the next-generation(s) learning system delivered to each prospect

* Prospect Intelligence - the AI system core

* Prospect Energy - Ultimately all of prospect-intel will have to be in complete harmony to fufill the energetic requirements to proceed.


- There is a universe to build upon.
